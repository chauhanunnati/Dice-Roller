A new Flutter project - Dice Roller.
The Dice Roller App is a simple mobile application built with Flutter and Dart.
 It simulates rolling a dice by generating a random number between 1 and 6 each time a button is pressed. The app uses both `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` to manage its user interface and state. With a single tap, users can see a new dice face displayed on the screen, making it a fun and practical tool for learning Flutter basics.
